👋 Hi, I’m @sukhdxxp, a web developer with experience in React, Node.js, MongoDB, Python, Flutter, and more.
👀 I’m interested in creating innovative web and mobile applications, and I'm particularly passionate about building user interfaces and working on hobby projects using a low setup.
🌱 I’m currently learning new technologies and exploring different ways to improve my skills as a developer.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects where I can contribute my expertise in web development and UI frameworks. I'm open to collaborating with other developers, designers, and anyone else who shares similar interests.
